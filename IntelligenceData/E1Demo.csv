S100307	22/June/2018	40	 F	3	1	0	?	 By how quickly they got to the target, and how many black squares they revealed along the way
S155074	22/June/2018	29	 M	2	1	0	O	 Faster they moved and solved it higher I would rate them.
S15951481	29/June/2018	38	 M	3	0	0	P	I tried to notice how quickly they corrected wrong paths, how many times they had to backtrack or repeated already covered ground.
S161305	22/June/2018	37	 M	1	1	0	O	Efficient path choices with minimal movement to explore.
S17111907	29/June/2018	29	 F	1	1	0	P	I based it off of their strategy. If they went to rooms that had fewer moves but uncovered more tiles first, I felt like they were thinking ahead of time
S180970	22/June/2018	31	 M	0	1	0	O	 Thanks, it was fun  Whether or not the user went into rooms first that had a wall in them, also if they backtracked any spots they were already at.
S22003768	29/June/2018	37	 F	2	1	0	O	By how many times somebody made a mistake and also how long it took to make a move
S220360	22/June/2018	37	 F	1	1	0	O	I looked at whether the player took the path that would lead them to the exit with the least amount of moves and whether or not the player went to unnecessary areas/already uncovered areas looking for the exit
S243110	22/June/2018	20	 M	3	1	0	P	When faced with a decision, did they take the path that gave them a better chance of finding the exit? Did they backtrack? Did they go to unnecessary spots?
S26412344	29/June/2018	32	 M	2	1	0	?	I looked at the path that they took
S268086	22/June/2018	26	 M	1	1	0	O	Based on how long it took them to get
S269946	22/June/2018	31	 M	0	1	0	O	 Fun!  If they took the shortest path
S276170	22/June/2018	33	 m	2	1	0	P	if they took the shortest path to cover the most ground without backtracking
S278591	22/June/2018	30	 M	3	1	0	P	I made it based on efficiency of uncovering the greater amount of black squares. I didn't really take into account how long it took them to find red, but more about whether they took moves to uncover more black squares efficiently
S291923	22/June/2018	33	 M	2	1	0	P	I used the course for answers. Which ever revealed the most black spaces was the best possible path.
S295043	22/June/2018	51	 F	0	1	0	O	 I judged by how many moves it took them
S31377411	26/June/2018	30	 F	2	1	0	O	I thought slow to figure it out = 1, whereas quick to find the spot = 5. I don't think intelligence actually has anything to do with it.
S33485765	26/June/2018	34	 M	1	1	0	P	 Good luck with your research! This was a fun and engaging task. I enjoyed it.  I think of intelligence in many ways. There's obvious academic intelligence, but in terms of these mazes, I think there was strategy involved for some that cued signs of intelligence. They were careful only to make as many moves as necessary to open up the area from the black squares. I think it is intelligent to explore and show curiosity as well. So, even if some people didn't find the exit right away, they showed a high level of curiosity which I believe is definitely a sign of intellect. The only people I rated low on intelligence chose to explore through a path already exposed with no sign of the exit in view. That would waste moves and shows a lack of strategy.
S356759	22/June/2018	38	 M	3	1	0	P	Taking routes that gave a look at the largest number of squares and also considering having to backtrack if it's in an unlikely spot. A good balance between these.
S359344	22/June/2018	27	 M	3	1	0	P	If they decided to backtrack on spaces they've already seen and skipping closer corridors
S36225400	29/June/2018	34	 F	0	0	0	O	I tried to remember a similar layout someone else tried to do and guess from that how the other person would do.
S368541	22/June/2018	26	 F	2	1	0	O	 Good study.  I thought about how quickly they were able to find the goal and how much time they &quot;wasted.&quot;
S421533	22/June/2018	23	 F	0	1	0	O	The patch that were taken and how long it took
S45086617	26/June/2018	28	 F	0	1	1	O	observing the movement that
S45559	22/June/2018	64	 M	2	1	0	?	whether there was a systematic exploration
S49340775	26/June/2018	23	 M	0	0	0	P	I thought about the risk reward of the person playing; how likely a block of squares was likely to contain the ending versus how many turns it would cost them.
S51254092	29/June/2018	35	 M	1	1	0	O	by how far they would go into a room they already cleared
S516473	22/June/2018	25	 M	0	1	0	O	 how many excessive moves were taken
S52699495	29/June/2018	24	 M	0	1	0	O	How long it took them
S546720	22/June/2018	26	 M	0	1	0	O	I generally gave higher marks if they did not back-track or do any unnecessary movements. I realize that a good portion of the time it was a 50/50 shot of choosing the correct path, but once that happens they needed to commit.
S557436	22/June/2018	38	 M	1	1	0	P	by how they moved, if they went for the easiest way to reveal the biggest groups of fog in each path. sometimes they would take a long way and get lucky. Other times they would have to backtrack. It was a bit of luck if they finished fast, but the methodology of reducing possible movement time is what I looked for.
S606018	22/June/2018	34	 F	0	1	0	O	If they took too long and didn't take obvious shortcuts, I marked them down and called them less intelligence.
S61025202	29/June/2018	42	 M	1	1	0	O	Based on the path that was taken and how quickly they were able to navigate towards the exit.
S62671361	26/June/2018	69	 F	2	1	0	O	 fun fun fun  If they went the shortest route to find out if it was there.This was easy except I was confused if we only saw part where it stopped I marked those as a 1. Maybe that was the wrong way to do that.
S629044	22/June/2018	19	 M	2	1	0	P	 Good luck!  Most efficient pathing, so if they went past something that would have been easy to check I'd say that is bad.
S63531323	26/June/2018	39	 F	2	1	0	?	 I looked at how quickly they changed course when you could tell the end wasn't where they were
S644057	22/June/2018	25	 F	3	1	0	?	I based it mainly on the paths chosen. If they took a path that was a couple steps longer I marked them down.
S65057399	29/June/2018	24	 M	3	1	0	P	I examined whether they made pointless or useless moves, and also examined whether they took the path that made the most sense to me. The path that made the most sense to me is the one that would minimize the number of moves you'd have to take if you were wrong, so if there were two paths you could take and one required a lot more moves you'd take the shorter path first so that you could find the dot on the longer path rather than take the entire longer path without finding the dot in the first place.
S65431083	26/June/2018	40	 F	3	1	0	P	According to how logical seemed their decisions and number of move observed
S65563428	26/June/2018	54	 M	2	1	1	?	Most of my determination was made in view of whether they could see where the exit was at the outset. 
S677286	22/June/2018	56	 M	3	1	0	P	detection of obvious, chocie of largest possible area first
S71252812	26/June/2018	47	 F	1	1	0	O	The fewer stops and the fewer turns they took the higher I judged their intelligence.
S73010474	26/June/2018	29	 M	2	0	0	O	 I based it on how quickly the face switched directions when the red dot was not in the room.
S74716187	29/June/2018	49	 F	2	1	0	?	 Thanks  If they backtracked much I would say they weren't that intelligent. It is hard to gauge as they have to check areas to see if the end is there.
S759268	22/June/2018	39	 F	2	1	0	P	I based it upon how thorough of a search they did and if they wasted any moves.
S78197418	29/June/2018	28	 M	0	1	0	O	Whether they took the shortest amount of time to get to each red circle and also whether they made unnecessary moves to empty spaces.
S84049839	29/June/2018	36	 F	0	1	0	O	how well or fast they found the circle
S86401540	29/June/2018	30	 M	3	1	0	P	I tried to assess whether the participant was taking the shortest reasonable path given their knowledge of the maze.
S88574813	26/June/2018	34	 M	3	1	0	P	I decided whether they took the most efficient path and rated accordingly.
S88693588	26/June/2018	27	 M	2	1	0	?	 Thanks!  how much time they spent going in directions that were clearly dead space
S915765	29/June/2018	59	 M	2	1	0	P	I judged what I would do in the same situation  by calculation possible odds.
S91975130	29/June/2018	42	 M	3	1	0	P	If they moved around needlessly or in a confused manner, they got 1. If they made a minor unnecessary movement, they got 2. Generally people got 3 because there's mostly only one obvious way to clear a map, a couple people got 4 because a couple maps did offer the ability to make wise/unwise choices.
S92692305	26/June/2018	42	 F	1	1	0	O	 have a great day  based on how fast the person found the exit
S92951792	26/June/2018	51	 F	3	1	0	P	By whether the person tested the shortest path to intelligence first.
S945650	22/June/2018	24	 F	2	1	0	P	I made evaluations of intelligence based on their efficiency and the way they picked their routes.
S948330	22/June/2018	59	 F	2	1	0	?	By how many wrong turns they took
S967196	22/June/2018	30	 M	0	1	0	P	I rated the people who revealed more black blocks per turn earlier as higher intelligence.
S970030	25/June/2018	54	 F	0	1	0	O	I evaluated the intelligence based on how many moves it took them to reach the red circle and if they did it with ease and not alot of back tracking
S9866609	26/June/2018	29	 F	0	1	0	O	Since they had to find the exit in a few moves as possible, I based it on wasted efforts, such as choosing to check a further area before a closer one, or needlessly going to the edges when you could already see there.
S99043	22/June/2018	44	 M	3	1	0	?	Number of moves and if they went into the easiest room to uncover was also a plus.
S991408	22/June/2018	34	 M	1	1	0	O	 Everyone that uncovered the whole map and got to the dot at the very end got a 3. If they backtracked, they got a 2 or 1. If they went straight to the dot and left a lot of the map uncovered, they scored a 4 or 5 depending on speed
