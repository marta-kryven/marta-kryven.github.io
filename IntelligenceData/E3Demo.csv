S40667849	11/September/2018	30	M	plan	0	NA	?	FALSE	0		 How efficient their movement was, whether they wasted movement or not. 
S42638665	11/September/2018	38	F	plan	2	NA	P	FALSE	0		 I ranked them more intelligent if they seem logical about how the went. The ones who were wishy washy or illogical I ranked as less intelligent
S42855525	11/September/2018	25	M	plan	2	NA	P	FALSE	0		 During certain trials, you have a choice to eliminate more ground or guess and rely on luck.  The people that moved to cover more ground to get a more consistent lower step rate are the people that got higher intelligence ratings. Thank you for having me in this study, it was pretty fun!
S53339341	11/September/2018	36	F	plan	3	NA	P	FALSE	0		 I tried to look at efficiency and how many moves were wasted.
S56648877	11/September/2018	32	M	attrib	1	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I tried to uncover as many of the blacked out blocks in the least amount of moves possible until I uncovered the exit.	
S60844577	11/September/2018	32	M	plan	2	NA	P	FALSE	0		 Based on efficient use of moves. I never used speed to determine the evaluation of intelligence.
S63486682	11/September/2018	41	M	attrib	1	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I tried to decide where there was a higher chance of the end as well as the number of steps.	
S67249347	11/September/2018	30	M	attrib	1	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I chose the moves that took me to the black in the least amount of steps.	
S68046782	11/September/2018	37	F	attrib	1	P	NA	FALSE	0	 THe most blocks that would open up sooner	
S73725792	11/September/2018	52	F	plan	1	NA	O	FALSE	0		 I tried to see if they would do what I thought was the best strategy - go up first and then to the right.  I also judged by how many steps it took to get there.  If they backtracked, that was a definite &quot;1&quot; Thank you - it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the little people in the maze :)
S76000415	11/September/2018	35	M	attrib	2	P	NA	FALSE	0	 Which way would discover the most blocks in the least steps.	
S79216412	11/September/2018	57	M	attrib	3	P	NA	FALSE	0	 Tried to use the shortest route that would expose any unknown areas Thank you!	
S88163248	11/September/2018	37	M	attrib	3	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I chose optimal routes based on how many squares I could illuminate in the least number of moves, in cases where it wasn't as obvious I simply went in the direction where I could illuminate many squares without doubling back too much.	
S88751795	11/September/2018	41	M	plan	2	NA	P	FALSE	0		 compared to what i would do, regardless of how lucky they got.
S90294912	11/September/2018	22	F	attrib	3	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I tried to go to the areas that were closest to me or those with the most black spaces first to clear those areas most efficiently.	
S94316089	11/September/2018	32	M	plan	2	NA	P	FALSE	0		 I figured the most intelligent way to go about it is to consider that each black block is equally likely to have the exit.  Therefore - it's most intelligent to go towards a path that will reveal the most black blocks as soon as possible.  If they did this - I figured they were intelligent.
S97767595	11/September/2018	49	M	plan	3	NA	?	FALSE	0		 It was fairly arbitrary in almost all cases. The info was too limited to make any reasonable conclusion.
S9954363	11/September/2018	55	F	attrib	0	P	NA	FALSE	0	 I tried to go where their were more squares to open up quicker	
S20065512	13/September/2018	33	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 Tried to minimize the number of potential steps I would have to take by exploring the black areas closest. Tried to avoid backtracking.	 I voted them 3-4 when they made moves that would keep them from having to backtrack. I voted 1-2 when they made moves that either caused them to backtrack, or might have led to them having to do so.
S20862983	13/September/2018	36	M	plan	0	G	?	FALSE	0	 I picked a random direction.	 If they made an intentional choice to think they knew where to go versus examples of blatantly not doing the task correctly. Have a nice day!
S21345720	13/September/2018	34	F	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to look for the closest group of blocks that I could clear first. If I couldn't find a large group I would just start with the closest block.	 I made the evaluation based on the most logical places to check first. If the person jumped randomly or check the blocks furthest away, I rated them lower than someone who checked the closer blocks or the sections that would reveal the most blocks at once.
S22365246	13/September/2018	30	M	plan	3	P	?	FALSE	0	 I went with the least amount of backtracking.	 How many useless steps they take. hi
S23005243	13/September/2018	34	M	attrib	2	?	O	FALSE	0	 I just took the best path possible! Thanks!	 I just counted the steps!
S31880173	13/September/2018	26	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I made my decisions based on the maximum amount of black squares I could uncover with the fewest steps since the exit could be behind each black square with an equal chance.	 I made my evaluations based on how efficient they were with their movement and whether or not the direction they took with their steps made sense for the amount of black squares they'd uncover.
S34404042	13/September/2018	37	M	attrib	2	P	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to use the option the the most black would be removed to increase probability and then the shortest routed to that point. fun, thanks	 If the person did not take advantage of the shortest route and just got lucky I marked them lower. When they walked around aimlessly I marked them very low
S35185193	13/September/2018	50	M	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 Moved the direction to the closest blacked out area first	 see how they chose which way to go and if they moved back and forth instead of contiueing
S35674788	13/September/2018	28	M	plan	1	?	P	FALSE	0	 Tried to go for the biggest black area, then I tried to just go with my gut instinct.	 Based on if they wasted moves, or if they skipped areas, or went to areas that are less likely to contain the goal. Nice study. I liked the game.
S35956460	13/September/2018	37	F	attrib	0	?	?	FALSE	1	 it came out of my mind I liked	 it came out of my mind
S36311954	13/September/2018	22	M	attrib	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to predict which part of the maze the exit was hidden and went in that direction. It was hard but I tried my best. I enjoyed this study!	 The fewer moves it took the person to make it to the end, the higher I rated their intelligence and vice versa.
S39259375	13/September/2018	35	M	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 Chose route that showed the most black in the shortest path This was a fun task	 The methodical way they searched
S42584966	13/September/2018	34	M	attrib	1	?	?	FALSE	0	 based on how I saw some of the other participants	 based on their moves, if they headed in wrong directions multiple times I found them no intellegent
S43727990	13/September/2018	30	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 Tried to figure out the most efficient way to clear out the black squares to find the exit.	 The efficiency of how they cleared black squares. For example if they took 3 steps to clear 8 black squares instead of 2 steps to clear a different 8 black squares, it's lower intelligence.
S44681444	13/September/2018	28	F	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to maximize the possibility of finding the red square, often by going towards where the most black squares were.	 If the person seemed to be doing things in a way that I thought was counter-intuitive, like going back and forth without going towards black squares or not going towards the closer space with black squares first, I would think that the person is probably less intelligent.
S47954771	13/September/2018	59	M	plan	2	G	P	TRUE	0	 I think I went by instinct. There may have been some mazes that influenced my choices but I could not describe them here; that is, without seeing them again.	 I determined if they took the route that offered the highest probability of finding an exit in the fewest steps; checking to see if they would uncover the most black squares in the shortest number of moves; at least that is what I tried to do. n/a
S48820499	13/September/2018	35	M	plan	3	?	P	FALSE	0	 I just tried to do it in the least steps.  I was mostly unsuccessful.	 I tried to decide whether they were efficient, lucky, or just plain stupid.  Often it was difficult to tell the difference between luck and efficiency. none, thank you
S51245291	13/September/2018	36	M	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to figure out which paths would go near the most black squares.	 I based it on what moves I'd've made.
S51917431	13/September/2018	29	 M	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to consider which paths would reveal the most squares in the least amount of moves in order to eliminate where the exit could be.	 I considered which paths would reveal the most squares in the least amount of moves. The trials which took the most efficient paths I rated higher than ones which took less efficient paths.
S53450532	13/September/2018	20	M	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to cover as much ground in as few steps as possible.	 I looked at the most logical paths to take and based it on what they did.
S54731735	13/September/2018	38	F	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I went the way that would take me the last steps and would reveal the most black squares to find the exit.	 If the person changed directions when they were close to black spaces that they could have check, i thought they were less intelligent. People who didn't seem focused or care about the amount of steps they took to get to the exit, I rated lower. People who got to the exit quickly or took a route that make the most sense I rated higher intelligence. The study was fun and interesting with a fair reward. Thanks you!
S54915935	13/September/2018	36	F	attrib	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I just trusted my intuition on where the exit might be.	 I based the evaluation on whether or not the person could successfully find the exit on the first attempt or not.
S58630026	13/September/2018	28	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I first tried to find the shortest path to the largest block of unseen (squares). However, if there was some unseen squares nearby that would not take many steps to see, I went to those first because the cost of not looking at those squares if they contain the exit is higher than the cost of looking at the squares.	 I evaluated the intelligence based on the player's proposed path and how effective it would be if the exit square was in the last place the player checked. In other words, the players that uncovered the largest black squares while wasting the fewest steps were more highly rated in intelligence. Those that wasted steps and retraced their steps for no good reason were rated lower. This was an interesting study. I would like to see a debrief page to learn about the goals of the study if possible.
S63331560	13/September/2018	48	F	attrib	1	P	O	TRUE	0	 I selected the path that had the most black squares no comments	 by how many moves they made to get to the exit
S6706391	13/September/2018	34	F	attrib	0	?	O	FALSE	0	 I tried to go the quickest route through the black boxes to find the exit in as little amount of clicks as possible. this was fun	 I saw how many clicks they took and also how quickly they could have looked for alternate routes to the exit.
S67143709	13/September/2018	36	F	attrib	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to take the least amount of steps towards a black square	 If they took the smartest way to get to teh most black blocks I thought they were intelligent.
S67813321	13/September/2018	31	F	plan	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I just trusted my gut instinct	 Based on how often they backtracked and how many steps it took
S75552164	13/September/2018	23	M	attrib	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to find the optimal strategy for using the least amount of moves.	 I tried to determine what the optimal strategy would be for each given level, and compare their performance to that.
S76429474	13/September/2018	28	M	plan	0	P	P	TRUE	0	 I decided based on how many white spaces it would take me to get to the black spaces and the number of black spaces that were available to reveal potential exits.	 I evaluated by how many moves it took them to get to black squares and if they choose to move to a higher number of black squares I considered them more intelligent.
S77798674	13/September/2018	53	M	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I generally moved toward the sections that contained the largest number of black squares.  I felt that the odds of the red square being in those locations was the highest.	 I determined if the player was moving in a consistent motion (not moving back and forth without checking black squares).  I also watched to ensure that they were moving toward the largest blocks of black squares. Fun game; no other comments.
S78693289	13/September/2018	39	F	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 wHICHEVER WAY HAD THE SHORTEST DISTANCE TO A WALL, i WOULD CHECK FIRST. IF THEY WERE EVEN, I JUST PICKED A WAY THAT SEEMED IT WOULD HAVE MORE WALLS TO CHECK IN LESS MOVES AND IF EVERYTHING WAS EVEN, I CHOSE RANDOMLY NONE, THANK YOU!!	 aT FIRST JUST IF THEY MADE IT, BUT AFETR I FEW I STARTED TO COUNT BLOCKS AND SEE IF THEY CHECKED THE CLOSER ONES FIRST. iF THEY CHECKED FROM SHORTEST DISTANCE TO LONGEST, i GRADED A 5 AND TOOK ONE OFF FOR EACH AFTER THAT IF THEY DIDNT CHOOSE THE SHORTEST DISTANCES TO CHECK REGARDLESS IF THEY FOUND IT QUICKLY OR NOT.
S79349616	13/September/2018	52	M	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to get the most squares revealed	 I gave the ones that made the most efficient use of their moves the higher rating
S80243580	13/September/2018	35	F	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 shortest way to black	 if they followed the easiest path
S87375450	13/September/2018	38	M	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to go to the closet black squares first.	 I based on on the paths they took, and if they were making too many steps.
S88406311	13/September/2018	21	M	attrib	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 Try to look at the closest unexplored area.	 I looked at how many spaces it would take to go to a unexplored area and i think the most efficient way is to check the closest unexplored area and also obviously wasted moves.
S97484137	13/September/2018	50	F	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I attempted to find the path that would open up the most black squares in as few steps as possible. If there was one path that was way shorter and would open up black squares, I would usually try that one first unless I had a gut instinct not to.	 No matter how fast they found the door, if they took the logical path that would search for it the quickest I rated them highly. If they took longer and meandering paths that just did not make sense for efficiency, I rated them lower. Interesting and different. Thank you for posting a study that is not a typical survey and challenges thinking!
S10324374	14/September/2018	31	M	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to make the least moves possible to areas with the most black	 Just based it off how I would do it
S12962124	14/September/2018	31	M	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 tried to take the shortest route that led to the highest number of black blocks	 how efficient their route was for least moves to uncover most squares
S13916827	14/September/2018	37	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 get the most black squares turned quickly	 missed blocks / logical movements
S15843264	14/September/2018	35	F	attrib	3	P	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to go in order of the black squares. So I went to the closest black first and then moved to the next closest black if I hadn't found the exit yet.	 Those who were able to get to the exit in smaller amount of steps got higher ratings for intelligence.  So basically speed was a big factor in my evaluation. Also, if they had to backtrack, I felt that they were less intelligent.
S16773879	14/September/2018	25	M	attrib	0	G	?	FALSE	0	 I just chose the path that would take me through the most black blocks and pray  that the red was under one of them. Everything worked well.	 By how they went about seeing the squares that were blocked.
S22826236	14/September/2018	29	M	attrib	2	G	O	TRUE	0	 trial and error thank you	 by how quickly they found the exit
S23980440	14/September/2018	25	F	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I chose which way had more black blocks to uncover.	 By which direction they chose to go and if it was what I would have picked
S24988002	14/September/2018	27	M	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to reach the areas where there were more black squares, those places were very likely to hide the exit of the maze.	 I was judging the number of steps they used to clear the black squares and reach the exit.
S26117990	14/September/2018	30	M	attrib	2	?	P	FALSE	0	 I tried to pick the quickest route. I answered thoughtfully, good luck!	 If they chose the most efficient path to check every unknown area.
S27054957	14/September/2018	29	F	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I looked for larger groupings of black blocks that were closer to me or paths that revealed the most number in the fewest steps.	 I looked for players who had a plan in mind that increased their chances of success such as going for larger groupings of blocks that were closer. I also penalized those who I perceived to do the opposite.
S30983862	14/September/2018	42	F	plan	2	G	O	TRUE	0	 I just followed my instincts. I really enjoyed this experiment. Thank you!	 I think most of participants found a good way how to find an exit. I would probably make a very similar decisions.. I would compare their performance to mine.. Thank you, I really enjoyed this!
S32389075	14/September/2018	28	M	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I started with the path that would both take the least steps and would check more unexplored areas in one motion.	 I evaluated them by the players' choice of first movement in the game. If the player chooses to first check unexplored areas that are near them then they have a higher intelligence but if the player starts with checking the longer path first then they have lower intelligence.
S37247548	14/September/2018	38	F	attrib	0	P	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to go the way with the most black squares.	 I evaluated how many moves or doors they opened to determine whether they were intelligent or not. The  more moves the lower score. The fewer moves the higher the score.
S47880134	14/September/2018	40	F	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 To the biggest black spaces that were the closest. it was awesome, thanks!	 Whether they went for the largest blocks of black squares first or the ones that were the closest to them.
S48246630	14/September/2018	46	F	plan	2	G	O	TRUE	0	 I had to just guess what side the red box would be on and adjust as I moved on. FUn task.	 I made my evaluation based on the number of moves and the distance they did. Fun task, thank you
S48764497	14/September/2018	57	F	plan	3	?	O	FALSE	0	 Usually toward where the most black squares were.	 I gave a better score if the person found the red square most quickly, although I believe there is luck involved as well as intelligence.
S5049796	14/September/2018	58	F	attrib	2	P	?	FALSE	0	 Counted out the shortest route, looked where the most black squares were This was a fun study	 How logical the moves were, if they went the shortest route, didn't back track, etc.
S51690095	14/September/2018	29	F	attrib	1	G	O	TRUE	0	 what i thought was the shortest route first	 based on how many moves were made forward and back, also if they went the best route
S5655017	14/September/2018	27	M	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to go where I could reveal the most black squares with the least moves possible.	 I made my evaluations based on their ability to make educated guesses about where the end would be based on probability. Although sometimes there wasn't enough info to gauge by that metric. In that case I decided based on the length of the maze and guessed that they were more of average intelligence.
S56697146	14/September/2018	45	M	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I went in the direction that had more black spaces because it was more likely for the exit to be in that location.	 I judged them based on how well they logically uncovered the black areas moving from areas with more black spaces to less. no problems
S56725788	14/September/2018	53	F	plan	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 Sheer luck	 Sheer luck! Fun game, if you do more, I'd like an email, please!
S57218193	14/September/2018	32	M	attrib	2	G	O	TRUE	0	 Went with my gut for most of it.  What would let me see the most area in the fewest steps.	 Which seemed to be the smarter path to take, not knowing where the goal was?  Did the person repeat steps?
S60296443	14/September/2018	27	F	plan	0	P	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to choose a block that would reveal the most white blocks as possible.	 I judged based on if they were trying to use the least amount of steps to get to the red block as possible.
S60481419	14/September/2018	26	M	plan	0	P	O	TRUE	0	 The way that had more squares.	 Based on the number of moves the person made.
S61596856	14/September/2018	46	F	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to uncover the largest black area first, since that had the greatest chance of a red square. Then I just took the route that would uncover things the quickest.	 I based it on if I thought the player made a logical search. If they went for the largest black areas and/or the shortest routes first. They got a lower score if the backtracked or didn't fully uncover an area they were in. This was fun. Thanks!
S64447835	14/September/2018	31	M	attrib	0	P	O	TRUE	0	 i tried to go to the side with the most black blocks i figured the odds were better the red spot was there	 i based my ratings on how much the user/player retraced their steps or went out of their way to find the red. the less steps to the red dot the better i rated them
S65033165	14/September/2018	38	M	attrib	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I just kept moving until I saw the red exit box. Thank you	 I based each on the amount of boxes(steps) walked over.
S65957857	14/September/2018	33	F	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I thought about which would take me the least amount of time.	 How efficient the movements were.
S75356747	14/September/2018	37	M	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I searched the largest groups of undiscovered tiles first.	 They were more intelligent if they searched larger groups of undiscovered tiles first and did not retrace their steps.
S76472040	14/September/2018	35	M	attrib	2	G	O	TRUE	0	 I just made decisions based on my instinct.	 By considering how many steps did the player took to find the way out.
S80237860	14/September/2018	43	F	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 tried to systematically uncover black blocks without having to double back this was kind of fun	 whether they were taking the most efficient path to clear black blocks and not leaving ones behind they may have to double back to uncover if they guessed wrong as to the exit location
S80451369	14/September/2018	34	F	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to go to the blocks that were bigger because I felt the exit was most likely to be there.	 If they went back and forth too much, it was low. If they went for big blocks, I rated them higher.
S81925124	14/September/2018	32	M	attrib	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I did not have a plan, I only made my way to what made sense, which was usually large amounts of black squares. thank you	 I determined my evaluations based on the choices the other players made. Some seemed to not understand, while others knew instinctively where to go and what would be the best way to find the exit in the least amount of moves.
S81938634	14/September/2018	23	M	attrib	1	P	?	FALSE	0	 I tried to search in the areas that had the most black. The more black there was, the more likely the exit would be located.	 I looked at the way they moved and their decision making. The path they took had to make sense. If they wandered aimlessly instead of searching in areas they were close to I rated them of lower intelligence.
S83316342	14/September/2018	28	F	attrib	3	P	?	FALSE	0	 to the nearest black ones	 excess moves by them
S8437531	14/September/2018	38	M	attrib	0	P	P	TRUE	0	 Same as I did when judging others intelligence.	 Who skipped squares that were close by and then went back, those who chose to go to areas with less squares, those who went back &amp; forth when they could of revealed a bunch of squares.
S85934455	14/September/2018	70	M	plan	1	G	O	TRUE	0	 I made my decisions by my instinct. This involved taking some risk and I am a risk taker.	 The longer the time the person takes to find the correct path, the less intelligence the person is. That was fun. I thought it would be tedious like typical psychology test in Mturk. Pay is great as well. Keep it up that pay and all the best in your research!
S8666998	14/September/2018	37	F	plan	0	G	O	TRUE	0	 I was trying to strategize but then found myself mostly working on instinct.	 Based on how few moves it took to get them to the red square and how quickly they decided on their moves. none
S88369855	14/September/2018	38	M	attrib	3	P	O	TRUE	0	 tried to use logic to use the least moves possible that was pretty cool	 by how quickly they found the exit and how many steps it took to do so
S885087	14/September/2018	31	M	plan	3	P	O	TRUE	0	 I tried to take the steps which revealed the most number of squares for the least travel distance.	 If they didn't optimize their path I rated them lower. My opportunities for mistakes gave the chance of rating even lower
S91206993	14/September/2018	47	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to balance being efficient with choosing a path that is more likely to have the door.	 I based it on how efficient they were.  I mean sometimes they went very far to check out a few black areas when it would have been smarter to check the closer larger clusters first.  Sometimes it made sense to check smaller ones first if they were close and then of course there's people who just had no real pattern or decision making and just wandered I gave those people a 1. It was interesting and different from the usual surveys/HITs.
S9217810	14/September/2018	31	M	attrib	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I counted the steps when there was a choice of direction and black spaces on each side. I also looked at the amount of black space and gravitated towards areas with more black space because I felt that there would be a higher chance of a red dot when you have more black space.	 I tried to judge whether it appeared that the figure came upon the red circle through chance or through algorithmic checking
S92888730	14/September/2018	55	F	attrib	0	?	O	FALSE	0	 most probably on how many black I could unhighlight and look for exit. Some luck as well.	 the people who found it quickly without backtracking were highly rated. everyone else who was indecisive or went back and forth were rated lower.
S9637638	14/September/2018	38	F	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to make moves that would uncover the most hidden spaces so I would have the best chance of finding the exit.	 I judged based on whether the person made moves to reveal the greatest number of hidden squares.
S9832863	14/September/2018	36	M	plan	0	G	P	TRUE	0	 Mostly on gut instinct. Sometimes if I saw a black box on the way to a larger set of black boxes, I took that route. I figured I could check off a lone black box in the process to see if the exit is under there. Two birds with one stone if you will.	 On how logically the moves seemed mostly. Sometimes the person moved in a really dumb direction, away from an area of black boxes but found the exit anyway. That was dumb luck, not intelligence. On the other hand, someone who moved in a methodical way using a logical route, but didn't find the exit for many moves just had bad luck, so I'd give that person higher intelligence. I'm really, really bad at logic puzzles like those above! On the other hand this was a fun survey and I enjoyed it. It worked fine and I had no issues. Have a good day!
S9950096	14/September/2018	24	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to look in the places that were closest to my character at first, just in the off-chance the exit would be there, then systematically go through the rest of the mazes based on distance.	 Based on their paths... I feel like people with more intelligence would rationalize moving towards the closer parts that are blacked out first, since the goal is to exit in the fewest moves. No major comments, but it was a very fun enjoyable task!
S18434430	01/November/2018	55	F	plan	0	P	?	FALSE	0	 Tried the shortest routes first.	 By the one that took the shortest route first. that was fun
S2929781	01/November/2018	52	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to reveal the hidden areas and used a little luck along the way.	 I evaluated the players on whether their decisions were logically appropriate given the probabilities and distances presented for revealing hidden squares.
S29949366	01/November/2018	37	F	plan	1	P	?	FALSE	0	 I picked the areas with the most black spaces.	 Whether they went to the most logical spots.
S35917504	01/November/2018	30	F	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I made my decisions based on what was closest to me to rule out any possibilities of an exit, so I did not have to back track. I learned after a few trials, that most of the exits were around more than 3-4 	 I made my evaluations based on the persons amount of movements, or if they became confused and went from side to side before going a direction. I really enjoyed this study. Thanks a lot!
S407868	01/November/2018	27	M	plan	0	G	?	FALSE	0	 I just guessed	 I based it off their movements none
S51773729	01/November/2018	24	M	plan	0	P	P	TRUE	0	 Which has the most spaces that I can see at once.	 Whether they take the appropriate steps or not.
S63587095	01/November/2018	34	M	plan	3	P	O	TRUE	0	 I went to areas where I could see the most black squares. I felt it gave me the best chance.	 How quick they solved the puzzles and how many moves. n/a
S6552560	01/November/2018	56	M	plan	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to find the shortest route to the most black squares.	 By how efficient were the choices made by the player in getting to the black squares. Best of luck in your research.
S69868382	01/November/2018	31	M	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I went took the shortest path toward the largest blocks of black squares because that is where the exit was most likely to be.	 I based my evaluations on what I believed were statistically or strategically the best moves to complete the task in the fewest steps, regardless of how fast or slow they actually found the exit. thanks
S72008323	01/November/2018	29	F	plan	1	P	P	TRUE	0	 I wanted to see as much of the maze as possible in the fewest amount of steps.  I also thought a larger black area was more likely to be hiding the maze exit.	 I looked at how the player evaluated the area and made a decision (don't repeat steps if you can help it, look at large areas first, etc).
S8416096	01/November/2018	26	M	plan	0	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to go whichever way had the most blocks to unlock.	 How thorough and efficient each player was, and how reckless.
S89190741	01/November/2018	33	M	plan	2	?	P	FALSE	1	 Sometimes I just took a guess and hoped I was right. Other times I chose to go the way that had the most blacked out areas in its path.	 I tried to see if anyone used any strategies while completing the mazes. I also looked to see if they made any dumb plays. Interesting and fun study.
S97317687	01/November/2018	35	F	plan	2	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to go in the direction of the areas with the most black squares to clear up the most of them for each step. I went in the direction of the biggest areas of black squares since it was a higher probability at least that the exit could be there.	 Since each black square is equally likely to be the exit, they should try to take the shortest path to uncover the most black squares at once and not take unnecessary steps. If they took lots of unnecessary steps and didn't find shorter ways to go about it, I judged them as less intelligent.
S30253846	02/November/2018	22	M	attrib	2	G	?	TRUE	0	 I relied on my gut feelings	 The path that they choosed.
S37731363	02/November/2018	40	F	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to make the choice that would make me take the least amount of steps to get to an unviewed area. This was a really fun survey to take, thank you!	 Unless they were either strikingly bad or strikingly good, I tended to give 3s or 4s because a lot of it seemed based on luck, to me.  If the person took a lot of unnecessary or nonsensical steps, I rated lower, and if they were exceptionally clever or competent, I rated higher.
S40686202	02/November/2018	25	F	attrib	1	?	P	FALSE	0	 I just tried my best	 When they made moves that seemed like they where making as iittle moves as possible some skipped boxes that where white an would of had to back trace to get back to that spot those were less intelligent
S94314178	02/November/2018	37	M	attrib	3	P	P	TRUE	0	 I tried to visit the largest unknown areas first, as long as the path to them wasn't too costly, since the larger areas had more of a chance to hide the exit. Thanks. The study was sort of fun. I wonder if the players I rated were real people or a computer.	 At some point I settled on the strategy of starting each player at 5 points on the scale, and then I would deduct 1 point for each action they performed that I thought was a mistake.
