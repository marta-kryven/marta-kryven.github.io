S11135	26/October/2016	0	26	M	3	G	O	84	 Mostly random I guess. I just followed wherever the black squares were. Tried to cover the entire area and not skip any black spots and go in order.	How much backtracking they had, how they moved throughout the game.                 
S123177	21/October/2016	0	29	F	6	G	O	66	This was really fun. Great interface. Most possibilities with fewest moves. Also tested out the theory that in mazes, it's always best to keep turning in the same direction. 	 Based on if they made the fewest moves and didn't go back on steps.
S126242	28/October/2016	0	33	M	3	P	P	83	 It'd be nice if I could navigate using the arrows on my keyboard.  I tried to go for the space with the most amount of hidden boxes first so that I could clear the most area as quickly as possible.	Watch if they did unneeded moves, to areas that the exit was not seen. To see if they left spaces unseen when they may have looked at them without adding extra steps. To see if they gravitated towards clearing large areas first.
S14208	21/October/2016	0	26	F	6	P	P	94	I went to the closest unknown space with the largest number of unknown potential exits to maximize my chances of finding the exit square 	 -was the movement logical? (not going back unnecessarily through uncovered space) -maximizing chance of uncovering the exit by hitting large spaces with clear LOS -not weaving through areas to uncover single blocks when easily accessible large areas still exist
S156147	21/October/2016	0	24	M	6	G	O	50	 I tried to look at the maze and see what would be a good place to hide the square and check it out. 	 Based on how quickly they could figure out where the dot was, as well as any unnecessary moves they took.
S16432	28/October/2016	0	22	M	6	P	P	50	 I tried to minimize the expected number of steps.	 I estimated the expected number of steps shown in the video divided by the minimum expected number of stops possible.
S164546	26/October/2016	0	44	F	6	P	P	8	 I tried to see the areas that were closer to me first and then continued to the further away areas.	I watched to see where they went, if they went places that were obviously not the exit, or if they kept going around in circles. I thought they were intelligent if they worked systematically to minimize steps.
S166242	26/October/2016	0	32	F	6	G	O	74	 Interesting task.  i went with my gut to be honest. whatever felt right	 Thank You how many steps they took
S180888	26/October/2016	0	36	F	6	P	P	100	 At first I picked randomly, but then I changed my strategy and decided to instead investigate the closest squares first in case the red square was there.	I marked people high that first investigated the closest areas (and fully investigated that area), then moved onto the sections that were next closest, even if this strategy led to more moves than randomly picking an area to investigate.  I think it shows more intelligence to have a plan than to randomly pick and hope to get lucky in your pick.  Low scores were for people that just moved over areas repeatedly that were empty (no reason to keep exploring that section).
S185508	21/October/2016	0	29	M	6	?	?	86	 It think I can do a little better. 	 Whether or not unnecessary moves were made, for the most part.
S191334	26/October/2016	0	26	M	3	G	O	80	 Thank you!  Intuition	 Thank you, fun study! Based on skill and pattern.
S20545	26/October/2016	1	27	F	5	?	?	48	 none  I simply tried to get to the red square as fast as I could.	 n/a I watched the face and its movements
S224593	28/October/2016	0	24	M	6	G	O	87	 One of the most interesting studies I have ever taken on mturk. Excellent game.  I mostly used intuition and some logic here and there.	 Interesting overall. I based my evaluations on participants that used the fewest steps to escape.
S235282	28/October/2016	0	28	M	6	P	P	79	 Since the exit was equally likely to be behind any of the black squares, I tried to clear them as efficiently as possible.	The animations were slow and I could not skip them even if I knew that the participant deserved a 1. I graded them on how efficient they were.
S247056	26/October/2016	0	28	M	3	P	P	47	 Everything worked, it was fun, thanks.  Just went by what I thought would expose the most blocks to try to uncover the exit faster.	Would have been nice if the ratings would have automatically started by themselves instead of having to start them each time. The route they took, if they took the route that would reveal the most black boxes in the shortest route, and if they took extra steps.
S248332	26/October/2016	0	34	F	3	G	O	78	 I tried to gauge the path, to guess which way the door might be. I am not sure that this was such a great method, as it seemed to take me too many steps to get there.	If the person went far past the steps necessary to determine where the door was, I ranked them lower.
S250296	26/October/2016	0	48	F	6	P	P	NA	 This really was a fun game. Thanks! It's nice to work on a fun HIT once in a while.  I tried to take the shortest path that would clear the black squares most at a time in order to get to the red square the quickest.	 This really was a fun survey to complete. It was a nice break from the norm. Thanks! I determined my evaluation based on the number of moves made. I also based my judgement on whether or not the movement was in a direction that would clear more black space vs. less.
S256137	26/October/2016	0	41	F	6	P	?	100	 Interesting task.  I tried to look at the map and take the route that would be the less moves first, and if that did not work then move on to the other parts.	 Very interesting tasks. The more logical the path taken the more intelligent.  The less steps it took.
S265716	26/October/2016	0	28	F	6	P	P	58	 Getting more black squared cleared with the fewest amount of steps	 n/a Whether I thought that it was the most efficient move or not
S269331	21/October/2016	0	62	M	6	?	?	22	 I tried to figure out the fewest steps to go. What seemed to be the most profitable if that makes sense. 	 When they tried to do the smaller part of the maze first.
S279506	21/October/2016	0	53	F	6	P	P	100	fewest steps to see the most squares 	 if they went to see the most squares and didn't take extra steps
S280055	21/October/2016	0	65	F	6	G	O	85	I just tried to follow the shortest path and hope for the best. 	 if they took the shortest path
S29058	26/October/2016	0	61	F	3	G	O	49	 It is a little bit mindless, which makes it nice.At first, it was just random. Then, I SEEM to notice that if I go either left or up, that the red square is in a direction that is against my initial wish to move in another direction. ummm...does this make sense? I had just begun to test my theory and it was working a bit.	 Is one of my own mazes in this intelligence test? I am afraid that one of my own attempts was recorded and it is now being replayed for me to judge it a &quot;1&quot;. At first, I may very well have made &quot;1&quot; performances, but I think I got better! By how quickly they got to the red square, without making redundant moves.
S293561	26/October/2016	0	68	M	5	P	P	31	 This is one of the more fun HITs I've worked on. A sincere Thank You for the work  I tried to make sure that any square I moved into would give me the most encompassing view of adjacent or 'distant' squares. [ If that makes any sense. :) ]	 Loved this HIT! On the 'sense' I saw in routing the smiley/character (e.g., &quot;does this move make any sense). That's the best way I can put it.
S294201	28/October/2016	0	36	M	3	G	P	90	 I went with my gut.	 n/a If they favored revealing larger spaces when faced with a decision. I rated them higher.
S294423	26/October/2016	0	41	F	2	P	P	100	 Thanks!  I picked areas that had the most black squares that would be opened at a time.	Other than that, this was a fun survey! I based it on whether the person backtracked or didn't go to areas with more black squares first.
S299579	21/October/2016	0	42	M	2	G	?	85	 It was more of a gut feeling and also the shorter of two routes 	 By the paths they took and how obvious the decisions were
S299693	26/October/2016	0	59	M	7	P	P	99	 none  I went to the area with the most black squares because odds would be better if random	By judging wasted moves and moves towards the highest number of black squares.
S311128	26/October/2016	0	26	F	6	P	P	84	 I tried to think of the most efficient way to examine as much area as possible.	 n/a If they made inefficient moves that cost more steps than necessary.
S319548	21/October/2016	0	36	F	6	G	?	0	It's a game, any time I get paid to play a game on mturk, I'm pretty happy.  I like the challenge and feeling smug when I get it right the first try. Just hoping for the best. 	 If they kept going over spaces that they didn't actually need to touch, I'd rate their intelligent lower.  If they clearly didn't read the instructions to how to play the game, they got a 1.
S334404	21/October/2016	0	30	M	3	P	P	61	Tried to be efficient while maintaining a short path. 	 Most efficient routes, whether they checked area so they wouldn't have to double back around, whether they made efficient use of their movements.
S336295	26/October/2016	0	32	M	5	G	P	94	 Just guessing.	 n/a Based on if they took the shortest path to see if they could reveal the exit the fastest.
S337973	28/October/2016	0	32	M	6	P	P	61	 This is a fun game!  I tried to uncover the most squares with the least moves, since probability states the exit will be in a place with the most squares.	 n/a Based on what I would have done.
S34222	26/October/2016	0	29	F	3	G	O	NA	 great game  i tried to make a rational choice but it always seemed random	 great game if a person went back over a area that they already covered or took unnecessary extra steps i rated them low. If the person had black squares till on the board when they found the red exit then i scored them high
S342386	26/October/2016	0	59	M	3	P	P	73	 I liked this.  I went toward the direction of more black squares since each square has an equal chance of having the exit.	 n/a Based on how many steps seemed to be a waste, or how often they went toward the higher numbers of black squares.
S34564	26/October/2016	0	19	M	2	P	P	37	 I tried to reveal as many blocks as possible with as few moves as I could.	 By how efficiently they used their steps         
S355417	26/October/2016	0	35	M	2	?	?	41	 I tried to check the shortest paths first	 n/a based on if they made any unnecessary or extra moves
S357773	21/October/2016	0	44	F	3	P	?	100	I tried to get to the closest black area to reveal, basically I just looked for the exit first/checked exit locations based on how efficiently I could do so. 	 If they clearly went where they didn't need to I scored them really low, most of the rest was random enough that I could only assume average.
S365730	26/October/2016	0	30	M	3	P	P	34	 Very fun survey. It keeps you attention.  I tried to uncover all the black squares that were closet to me, so I wouldn't have to back track. Also, when a path split into 2 directions I chose the path with the most black squares.	I used the decisions I would have made to solve the maze versus the decisions that the other participants took.
S368470	26/October/2016	0	59	F	2	P	?	6	 Found this fun and interesting  I would go towards the area with most black doors since i figured that would increase my chances of having an exit	 I enjoyed this task if they made less moves, moves that made sense to me, or moves that i would have made.
S37550	26/October/2016	0	52	M	5	P	P	NA	 Fun!  It's random. It's a guessing game. Sometimes I go far, sometimes I go near. It's luck. There are routes that can reveal the most squares faster though, and I try to take those.	Being systematic is a true sign of intelligence. Everything else is a gamble. If the gamble pays off, then you look like a genius. But it's only luck, and luck is not consistent.
S376806	21/October/2016	0	27	M	2	P	P	53	 If I was in the middle of a room and it would take me equal steps to go to each side, I would pick the side with more black squares since the chances of the goal being there were higher.  Sometimes I would go for the odd 1 or 2 squares that were left after uncovering a group because I decided it was worth the risk.  It would pay off if the goal happened to be there and it would be a huge waste of steps if I uncovered everything else and had to go all the way back. 	 I learned some things from watching that I didn't really think of when playing myself.  If there was an  equal amount of steps to one side, but you could uncover the whole room in that move, you should always go for it instead of the side that is blocked by walls.  The previous things I learned still apply mostly, like it is usually worth it to take that one extra step to uncover those few remaining ones instead of having to go back and retrace your steps, even if it's unlikely the goal is there.  Some of the tests were really easy to judge as unintelligent if they made unnecessary moves, moving around a room that is already uncovered.
S381257	21/October/2016	0	38	M	2	G	O	43	This is really fun, though it'd be nice to be able to click ahead [like 2 squares] instead of having to click on each one. I just sort of chose randomly, but with a bent towards left. 	 By how much useless steps/retracing took place and how quickly the exit was found.
S391243	26/October/2016	0	27	F	6	P	P	60	 I loved this survey very much!  I based my decisions on which would clear the most blocks in the shortest amount of moves.  I tried to stick to that.	 Great Hit! I made my evaluations based on whether the person made useless moves.  Not necessarily if they had gotten to the target the fastest.
S394005	26/October/2016	0	31	F	6	G	P	84	 I just guessed.	 n/a If they made the best decisions as far as how many blocks would clear, how many blocks there were, etc.
S398678	21/October/2016	0	46	M	2	P	P	75	 I tried to see the most in the least moves.   	 Thank You.         How many moves were used to see the most area.
S402333	28/October/2016	0	29	M	6	P	P	71	 It didn't seem like the exit was truly random or equally likely to be behind any of the black squares. It was usually, if not always tucked away at the end of a row or in a corner. It never seemed to be behind one of the first few black squares, or on a main path.  I tried to go the direction that would make the most black squares become visible, where the exit was most likely to be based on the number of black squares in that area. I generally checked black areas I was near first, before going further.	 Everything worked fine, thanks I decided based on whether the person was making smart moves, minimizing potential moves, exploring locations that would reveal the most black squares in the fewest moves, and moving to where the exit was most likely to be.
S409816	21/October/2016	0	48	F	7	G	O	78	 It just seemed the right way to go, there was really no logic just intuition. 	 Some of the balls in the mazes stuck before completing. For those instances I rated a three since I couldn't fairly judge. Otheruwise this was fun. If the user continued down the path after seeing there was no possibility of the red circle being there I rated intelligence low. If the user deducted the best options I rated them high.
S411804	26/October/2016	0	38	F	2	P	P	26	 I enjoyed this game. Thank you for allowing me to participate.  At first, I just moved toward the black squares. Then, I tried to move toward the squares that would &quot;uncover&quot; more black squares at one time.	 I enjoyed this game...playing it, and watching others play it. I judged according to their decisions to take the path that would reveal more black squares at one time. I also noticed some players were better at saving moves by revealing small sections first so they wouldn't have to come back to them.
S413158	21/October/2016	0	29	F	5	P	P	2	I tried to open the area with most black boxes to narrow down my choices. One click out of the way now to reveal a possible red box will save me many clicks later. 	 Open the closest available with the most black boxes so you don't have to backtrack. Those got higher scores. Those that explored what obviously didn't have a red dot, got lower scores.
S414838	28/October/2016	0	38	M	5	P	P	45	 Where I could uncover the most (see) at once.	 n/a On how many moves the player made and how many blocks the player could uncover based on the optimal movement.
S415189	21/October/2016	0	38	F	4	P	P	43	 I didn't do as good as I hoped I would but it was still fun. I tried to go whichever way had multiple areas where the red spot could be, I figured it would double my chances in finding it. 	 I think the ones that went to areas that had more available squares were smarter.
S419107	26/October/2016	0	30	F	2	P	P	100	 Tried to reveal as many black squares as possible and go from there.	 n/a On how their decisions were made. If they made unnecessary moves, I rated lower.
S421809	28/October/2016	0	44	M	6	P	P	81	 tried to play the best odds; chose routes that would expose the most squares and I did not want to have to backtrack and waste moves so I explored each section as it came for the most part.	 n/a Did they make moves that would minimize the number needed to make AND not have to backtrack unnecessarily since there was an equal chance it could be behind any square.
S42633	21/October/2016	0	29	F	3	P	P	100	I tried to pick the route that uncovered the most black squares first. 	 I tried to judge on how many odd moves they took.
S455320	21/October/2016	1	28	F	6	G	O	18	 I just guessed because I had no idea. 	 To see if they took the least amount of steps. A lot of the animations stopped in the middle and didn't complete, may be the website not working
S482085	28/October/2016	0	29	 M	3	P	P	34	 Thanks, it was fun!  I tried to maximize the number of black squares I'd reveal with each move. I would make sure my path would reveal all black squares along the way, since every black square (supposedly) had an equal chance to be the exit.	 n/a I compared their moves to the moves I would make. If they did something completely silly like wasting moves I would give them an automatic 1.
S489428	21/October/2016	0	29	M	6	G	P	88	 It was pretty random so I didn't really have a strategy. I just went with my gut. 	 Sometimes it would depend on if the player navigated to unnecessary space that was already visible or skipped areas I would've checked first.
S490917	28/October/2016	0	31	F	2	G	O	23	 Mostly guessing and with some feeling that I should go in one direction more than the other.	 n/a The number of moves that were used
S49292	26/October/2016	0	30	F	6	G	O	94	 I just went with my gut, there was no way to know.	 n/a Based on how many unnecessary moves were made.
S505076	26/October/2016	0	51	M	4	P	P	46	 I decided to choose the past - firstly at least - with the most black blocks.	 n/a Whether or not they chose the path with the most black blocks so as to increase their chances. And whether or not they made unnecessary movements.
S507343	28/October/2016	1	35	M	6	?	?	87	 based on what i saw	 n/a based on what i saw
S524015	26/October/2016	0	32	M	3	P	P	94	 This was quite fun. Thanks!  I tried to prioritize unveiling the areas closest to me first. This strategy did not work out well at all!	 n/a Moving in as few steps as possible as well as clearing the closest and largest areas first earned a high intelligence rating from me. Unnecessary movements gained the lowest ratings from me.
S528885	21/October/2016	0	38	F	6	P	P	86	 I tried to find the closest square that would let me see the black squares, then I decided which way the most squares and usually went that way, so I could eliminate as many squares as possible. 	 I saw which moves made sense, and whether they went back over empty squares for no reason, then rated accordingly.
S531684	21/October/2016	0	31	M	3	P	P	83	 I'm skeptical that the exit was &quot;random&quot;. It was never close. I tried to reveal as many black squares as i could in the shortest amount of moves. Sometimes I would gamble a bit and ignore a small section in favor of revealing a bigger one.     	 If they took what I thought was the fastest route they scored high. If they did something pointless or revealed a few square instead of a lot they scored. Sometimes I wasn't sure if they did the right thing or not so i scored them above average.
S553913	21/October/2016	0	28	M	6	P	O	70	 Most revealed cells was my goal. 	 Least moves!
S559226	26/October/2016	1	42	F	5	?	?	93	 great survey  by clicking the mouse	 na by moving space to space
S582832	26/October/2016	0	31	M	2	P	P	72	 It was really fun.  I tried to reveal the most squares in the fewest amount of steps.	 n/a If they took routes that did or didn't reveal the most blocks efficiently. Like passing up an extra step to reveal 5 or more blocks just to get to a spot that reveals 1
S599357	21/October/2016	0	32	M	6	G	O	63	 Randomly 	 How many steps they took.
S600079	21/October/2016	0	39	M	6	P	P	63	 It was an interesting survey and more fun than normal. I tried to clear all the black squares that were closest to me first, even if it took more steps. 	 How logically the person searched the area.
S600877	26/October/2016	0	28	M	6	?	?	65	 I chose routes the looked to be shortest.	 n/a Whether or not the path was logical.

S622759	26/October/2016	0	23	F	1	G	O	49	 No comments  Randomly	 n/a How quick they got to the end
S625801	26/October/2016	0	27	F	2	?	?	NA	 No Comments.  I just went with what felt right to me.	 No Comments. I just went with what felt right to me.
S633374	21/October/2016	0	27	M	6	G	P	91	 This is fun. I just tried to guess where it was and where the least suspected place would be. 	 I figured how many black squares were in the path that they chose. If they chose a path with a higher chance of uncovering the red circle, I rated them higher. I rated the ones that made many mistakes low on the scale.
S646424	21/October/2016	0	28	M	6	G	O	15	 I based it on intuition. 	 I based it on how quick it took the person to find the red dot.
S649302	28/October/2016	0	34	M	7	P	P	23	 I tried to figure out the most efficient way to uncover most of the boxes. When faced with a decision between two ways to go I assumed that the door had an equal probability of being in each box and first went in a way which would uncover more boxes.	 n/a If the person took the most efficient route in uncovering boxes
S653044	26/October/2016	0	29	F	9	P	P	80	 This would actually make a fun strategy game if it were available outside of the study. generally by the least steps to uncover the most black squares 	 This would be a really fun game to have on a computer. My office mates watched the mazes and all wanted to play.     Whether they backtracked (which meant generally that they covered more space than necessary) and whether they took an optimal route       
S661572	21/October/2016	0	52	M	5	?	?	44	 shortest route 	 how efficiently they moved
S666066	28/October/2016	0	23	F	6	G	?	67	 By giving my best guess	 n/a just by looking
S673562	28/October/2016	0	33	M	6	G	O	89	 there is a lot of guessing here  i tried to be as efficient as possible but a lot of times I had to guess	 n/a i tried to base it on if I would do the same thing and how few of steps were taking
S680947	21/October/2016	0	52	F	6	P	P	37	 I think I was getting better:) I tried to clear the most squares at one time to see the most white/hopefully red. 	 If they went to the biggest group to solve first, that was the more intelligent decision even if it did not work out for them.
S699104	26/October/2016	1	25	M	2	?	?	84	 i followed the which ever  walls/doors opened.	 n/a They were fun and entertaining to watch.
S701323	26/October/2016	0	35	M	3	G	P	90	 I used intuition to try to pick the correct path to go, but sometimes I just logically tried to clear nearest black squares first just in case the red square was nearest to the starting location.	 n/a I judged based on the logic of trying to open up the closest black areas first before moving on to further black areas.
S702215	28/October/2016	0	45	M	3	P	P	81	 I enjoyed this!  I tried to get the most bang for my buck.  In otherwords go where there was more black squares if it was close enough.  Sometimes though it was more efficient to just hit some of the lesser areas just in case as it would not have been good to have to back track.	 It was very unusual and interesting. Same way I made my choices before.  But I mean if they were completely wasting moves like going to areas that clearly had no exit I gave them a 1.  Otherwise sometimes it may not have been efficient but I could see they were gambling or other times they just were not sure and I felt that was more less intelligence.  Just because they found something quickly too didn't always mean I thought they were smart but just lucky.
S717976	26/October/2016	0	30	M	6	?	?	87	 By think which way have less step to take	 Nope Basic on how much step he need and how he movie with some unnecessary step
S722906	26/October/2016	0	30	M	5	G	O	67	 Just guessed	 n/a How many steps and how fast they made it to the red dot.
S723916	21/October/2016	0	23	F	2	G	O	90	I went where i thought the red square would be and if the red square was on one side of the maze in the last 2 games, in the next game i tried the opposite side 	 I looked at whether they went over a spot they already went over. And i just noticed near the end of watching these that you could see the red dots through the black if you look carefully, just great lol.
S727474	21/October/2016	0	50	F	5	P	O	76	 I tried to pick the path that would clear the most black squares 	 less movs
S737098	26/October/2016	0	61	F	2	G	P	58	 I have always felt my best guess was pretty good not so today. I had to take a lot of steps  I tried to make my best guess as to which way to go.	I based them on what I thought would be the least amount of moves even if they got it right going a different route.
S738760	21/October/2016	0	62	M	5	P	P	93	 It was fun. Thanks! I went where I thought I could view the most area at one time. 	 If it was a good route to take
S748157	26/October/2016	0	25	M	6	G	?	76	 was quite a bit about luck!  It seemed like the red square was placed in inconvenient locations, so I tried them first.	whether they made the best &quot;meta&quot; decisions.  Didnt waste moves.
S74893	26/October/2016	0	23	M	3	P	?	100	 I tried to go to where more blocks would open up	 n/a I went with my gut feelings
S75262	26/October/2016	0	31	M	6	P	P	71	 I went where the most black blocks were.	 n/a If they went to an area with less black blocks to explore, I marked them with lower points. If they went to the same areas more than one time, I marked them low.
S76694	26/October/2016	0	40	M	3	G	P	17	 On of my favorite hits I've done so far, thank you.  It was mostly gut feeling, also the a little bit of the quickest way to uncover the most black squares.	based on wasted movement and whether or not I felt they could have uncovered more unknown squares with shorter moves.
S767416	21/October/2016	0	50	M	6	P	P	41	 I enjoyed it!  Thanks! Tried to decide to how minimize moves necessary to see all squares. 	 Thanks! Compared to least possible moves to solve.
S769114	26/October/2016	0	27	M	2	P	P	50	 This was actually quite fun.  I'd try to clear as many black squares as I could in as few moves as possible to try to ascertain the position of the red square.	 n/a I tried to evaluate how they made progress toward the goal. I ranked people who I thought tried to think about it logically higher than the ones who I believed were more random or put less thought into it.
S771420	26/October/2016	0	39	M	3	G	?	87	 I went with my gut instinct	 I went on my gut instinct on how well they performed
S773407	26/October/2016	0	27	F	6	P	P	100	 This was interesting.  I took routes that would allow me to reveal as many black blocks as possible in the least amount of steps.	 This was interesting and fun. I looked to see if they were making efficient choices. By that I mean the least amount of spaces moved to reveal the largest amount of black squares.
S776069	26/October/2016	0	31	F	7	G	O	37	 This was fun  I figured the exit was the farthest away	 n/a The faster they finished the maze, the smarter they seemed
S781012	26/October/2016	0	31	F	5	G	O	77	 Fun game  Just relied on a gut feeling, now real way to tell which direction was the correct one.	How many moves it took to reach red circle
S78642	26/October/2016	0	51	F	2	G	O	95	 Fun but frustrating :o)  Gut instinct	 Thank you! If they made less moves overall
S795207	28/October/2016	0	29	F	7	P	P	93	 This was fun. Thanks!  I tried to think about the probability that the red square would be in certain areas and went for that route. Sometimes I was wrong, and sometimes I was right.	 n/a If they made unnecessary movements, I judged them as less intelligent. If they looked at the probability of a certain route, I rated them as higher intelligence.
S818256	26/October/2016	0	30	M	6	P	P	81	 I cleared out as much black area as possible at first so that I would not have to go back and check areas that were not cleared (at least not as much).	 n/a Whether the path was retraced more often than necessary
S826168	26/October/2016	0	28	M	5	P	O	79	 none  I based them off how many the average steps it would take to get to the red door.	 n/a by how many steps it took them to find the door.
S852951	26/October/2016	0	40	F	2	P	P	89	 I just tried to go to areas where I could uncover the most black squares at the same time.	 n/a I determined if the path they took was the most efficient in uncovering the black squares.
S854503	21/October/2016	0	30	F	3	P	P	41	I try to clear the most black squares in the fewest moves as possible so i don't have to move backwards. 	 If they went back over their same tracks and if they checked all the black areas before moving on to a different section
S858712	26/October/2016	0	26	M	2	P	P	14	 At first i decided to check the last place i thought it would be but that seemed to be wrong almost every time. Then i tried to check the first place id think it would be and it was right more often.	Based on shortest route to a possibility. If its 2 blocks to check an area and you go 5 blocks to check an area even its it was in that area it was not a smart move.     
S882638	28/October/2016	0	27	M	3	P	P	56	 tried to view as many black spots with my movements so i could see if the exit was there	 based on the smartest movements ie uncovering the most blocks with the smallest amount of movements, finding the exit on bad moves is luck not intelligence
S890803	26/October/2016	0	35	M	2	P	?	13	 I tried to check the closest spots first and go from their	 Thx for study On how many extra steps they did not have to make
S896860	26/October/2016	1	25	M	6	?	?	74	 Went to the end as best possible	 n/a I'm pretty smart
S898785	26/October/2016	0	36	M	6	P	P	83	 fun game, I enjoyed it.  I thought about the best path to take and how I could rule out as many spots as possible.	 n/a If they made logical and correct assumptions and searches, I found them to be intelligent.
S913185	21/October/2016	0	33	M	6	P	P	36	 Just trying to explore as much as possible in the shortest routes. Assuming the exit is equally likely among all the black squares. 	 To see if they tried to explore as quickly as possible, and reduce the worst case scenarios. The red exit didn't exactly have an equal chance of appearing at any black space.
S926415	21/October/2016	0	45	M	9	G	P	99	 I went to the first available black space first, and then pretty much guessed. 	Whether the person moved toward the most probable location on the mazes; whether s/he corrected quickly
S932984	26/October/2016	0	41	F	6	P	P	96	 I tried to look for options first that would need the least moves to get there.	 n/a If the person went to spaces that they didn't need to, I rated less
S934665	26/October/2016	0	36	F	6	?	?	NA	I made my decisions intuitively ad also based on what I thought was the most logical way out.	 Thanks so much for the study! How logical and deliberate the person was as far as directing the smiley face through the maze.
S94248	26/October/2016	0	30	M	3	P	P	7	 Thanks.  I tried to uncover as many black spaces as I could with as few clicks as possible, but it didn't always work.	 Thanks. If they used as few steps as possible to reveal the most black spaces, they got high marks.
S952115	28/October/2016	0	36	F	6	G	O	79	 I knew the red square could be anywhere so I just took my best guess and went with my gut instinct.	 n/a People that took knowingly unnecessary moves received a one or two. People that seemed to go straight to the red dot without wasting any extra moves, received a 4, even though it may have just been luck. Everyone else received a 3.
S97579	28/October/2016	0	29	F	6	P	P	54	 Interesting study!  I tried to find the route that would get rid of as many black square in as few steps as possible	 Very frustrating that the puzzles moved so slowly! By how efficiently they moved
S976844	26/October/2016	0	31	F	3	G	O	20	 That was fun. I really enjoyed it.  I just took some guesses	 n/a Just how many moves it took them and if it was only shown partially I would always put 3.
S981207	26/October/2016	0	31	F	5	P	P	79	 tried to head to areas with more squares/where it was more likely the exit was located	 n/a if they followed the paths that I would have taken I guess... heading to areas with more squares and shorter distances
S983016	28/October/2016	0	32	M	6	P	P	100	 I tried to uncover as many of the black boxes with as little movement as possible.  After that I just kind of guessed where I thought it might be.	 n/a By the choices that they made and the route they took.  If they went to spaces that didn't get them closer to finding the red dot I marked them down points.
S983809	26/October/2016	0	26	M	6	G	?	42	 Intuition	 n/a if it went against common sense, it was not intelligent.
S989739	26/October/2016	0	30	M	6	G	P	88	I really didn't make a choice. I just chose a side and random and hoped it worked out.	 n/a I just went with how efficient a bot seemed. Some took less optimal paths, or reworked illuminated squares, so they got rated lower.
S990120	26/October/2016	0	25	F	3	G	O	99	 I just kind of went randomly down the mazes and guessed which direction the red square would be.	 n/a Based on how many times some had to backtrack when they passed by certain points in the maze.
S994778	26/October/2016	0	39	M	6	G	?	95	 Good game,no problems.  I took my best guess.	 Good study. I based it on how the moved were taken and if unnecessary moves were made.
