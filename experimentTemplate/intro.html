Welcome to our study!<br><br>
<font color='red'><b>IMPORTANT!</b> This study runs on a desktop/laptop.<br><br> 
The study will <b>NOT </b> run on a mobile device.</font><br><br>
You need to be focused to do this experiment, please make the browser window as big as you can and avoid distraction.<br><br>  
	
<b>Multiple Object Tracking</b> 
<br><br>You will see several moving objects presented in the center of the screen and a background image surrounding the objects. 
<br><br>Some of the objects are targets. 
<br><br>The target objects will blink before the animation starts. Others are distractors.	
<br><br>Your task is to track the targets and ignore the distractors.
<br><br>When the animation stops, please click on the objects that you were tracking.	
<br><br>The animations starts slow, but gets faster later on. Please try to keep up!	
<br><br>The study is expected to take 10 minutes.
Thanks for participating!
