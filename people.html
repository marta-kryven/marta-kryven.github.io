<h2>Research Area</h2>
<p> 
People excel at real-life tasks that are challenging for modern AI, such as planning and learning new tools from a few examples. 
How do we solve real-world problems so efficiently?</p>
    
<p>
Our lab builds models of intelligence in humans and machines by developing computational models
grounded in cognitive science, AI theory and empirical experimentation. These models provide foundations for advancing the science of intelligence.</p>
    
<p>The lab explores questions such as: <br>
– How do people plan, navigate, and explore in the real world?<br>
– How do people formulate world-models and generate hypotheses about how the world works?<br>
- How can humans and machines work together to invent new concepts and tools?<br>
</p>

<h2>Working in our lab</h2>
<p>
Our lab connects a highly collaborative group of researchers at various stages of their careers, and actively engages in international collaborations. 
We use research methods accross artificial intelligence, neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology.<p>

<p>Lab workflow is organized around several distinct projects with weekly online meetings.
The projects are organized around conference dealines, with an eventual jounal pubication, after which it is wrapped up. 
Students are expected to gradully develop independence and led projects of ther own.

<p>Because conference participation in highly important for integrating into the international sceintific community, the lab will prioritize funding travel for major AI/CogSci conferences before other expenses.
We may also encorage submitting to non-major conferences, as long as they offer strong networking oportunities (e.g. COSYNE, CCN).
Graduate students are encouraged to actively seek various scholarships, fellowships, and stack different sources of funding support -- as is the standard Canadian model. 
Advisor funding will be offered to lab members, however the Canadian funding structure is not desgned for using a sole source of funing as a living income. 
Therefore, funding acquisition is a highly important aspect of any Canadian graduate student, and is treted as a technical skill everyone should learn.</p>

<p>We accept expressions of interest from prospective PhD students and undergraduates interested to build research experience.</p>
<p>While I do not generally offer funding MSc students, I am open to prospective PhD applicants who do not have a MSc, but have prior research experience.</p>
            
<h2>Lab member responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Write code, develop and implement computational models</li>
  <li>Prepare weekly (or bi-weekly) slides and progress reports for meetings with academic advisor(s) </li>
  <li>Work effectively with the group toward meetig conference conference deadlines (NeurIPS, ICLR, Cognitive Sciences Society)</li>
  <li>Assist with, and eventually lead, journal paper preparation (i.e., PLOS, Cognition, Nature group's journals) </li>
  <li>Analyze data, fit statistical models, and generate plots</li>
  <li>Contribute to teaching master and bachelor level courses as a teaching assistant</li>
  <li>Design behavioral experiments, and write scripts to process behavioural data</li>
  <li>Present your work as posters and talks, both informally to our collaborators, and at various conferences</li>
  <li>Contribute to a collegial group atmosphere</li>
  <li>Proactively apply for scholarships and seek funding opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PhD candidate requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Successfully completed a master’s degree (or equivalent research experience) in a quantitaive discipline, such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, math, physics, computer science or a related disciplines.</li> 
  <li>Excellent command of written and spoken English.</li>
  <li>Strong mahematical foundations, an ability or willingness to formulate and prove theorems, and analyze algorithm convergence on the theoretical level. 
      However, if you are a strong psychology or neuroscicnce graduate without a solid math background, we woudl still like to hear from you.</li>
  <li>A record of publications in international-level venues, or pervious research experience with strong references.</li>
  <li>A self-motivated, organized and proactive.</li>
  <li>A working knowledge of programming languages (e.g., Python, R), statistics and AI/ML.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with LLM and scientific computing libraries will be an asset.</li>
</ul>
