            <h2>Map perception as program synthesis</h2>
            
            <p>The key characteristic of real-world problems is their compositional, semi-regular structure, such as predictable patterns of hills and valleys in nature, or structured street networks in built environments. 
            Computational study of how people plan in such contexts is central to engineering resource-efficient AI that can plan with a human-like efficiency, while adapting to increasing problem scales. 
            In this project we integrate AI, Large Language Models and cognitive psychology to develop a computational understanding of how people conceptualize maps, and plan in realistic spatial navigation tasks.</p>
            
            <h2>Planning to learn, and learning to plan</h2>
            <p>Existing cognitive models of planning (e.g. in games like chess) tend to pre-specify possible planning models as anchored to classic algorithms, such as MDP solvers and stochastic search. 
            In contrast, people likely maintain and learn an evolving library of planning strategies encoded as mental programs. 
            In this project we explore approaches to modeling how such libraries of programs evolve and grow through social interaction and experience.</p>
